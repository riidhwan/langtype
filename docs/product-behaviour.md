# Product Behaviour

This file must be kept up to date whenever product behaviour changes. If you add, remove, or change a user-facing flow, update this file as part of the same task.

## Theme Toggle

A fixed button (bottom-right, visible on every page) switches between `warm` (light) and `ink` (dark). Shows a moon icon in light mode and a sun icon in dark mode. The chosen theme is persisted in `localStorage` under key `lt_theme`. The inline script in `RootDocument` (`__root.tsx`) reads this key before hydration to prevent FOUC; React state in `RootComponent` syncs from `localStorage` on mount and writes back on toggle. Default is `warm`.

## Home Page (`/`)

Collections are sorted by most-recently-played (`lastPlayedAt` in Zustand). A search input filters by title/description; "Due (N)" tab narrows to collections with at least one card due. Skeleton rows are shown until the SRS store hydrates (`_hasHydrated`) to prevent sort-order flicker. Tag pills appear below the All/Due tabs when any collection has a `tags` field. Clicking a tag (single-select) filters to collections containing that tag; clicking the active tag deselects it. Tag, All/Due, and search filters are ANDed. Collections without a `tags` field are visible when no tag is active and hidden when a tag is active.

A "Create collection" action opens the custom collection draft flow. Valid custom collections are shown alongside built-ins with a "Custom" marker and an edit action. Drafts are saved locally but hidden from the practice list until they have a non-empty title and at least one challenge with a non-empty answer.

## Dictionary Page (`/dictionary`)

The Dictionary page searches a static German dictionary published to Cloudflare R2. Search starts after three normalized characters and is debounced while the user types. Prefix search covers lemmas and useful inflected forms, so `arb` can find entries such as `Arbeit`, `arbeiten`, and `Arbeiter`, while `gearbeitet` can find `arbeiten`. Loaded prefix shards are cached in memory so extending a query filters locally instead of refetching the same static data.

Results show the lemma as the primary result label, part of speech, noun article when known, and whether the row is a lemma or form match. Form matches show the matched inflected form in the secondary text, such as `matched isst · form`. Lemma matches rank ahead of form matches and duplicate entries are collapsed.

Selecting a result loads the entry bucket and renders available details. Nouns may show article/gender, genitive, plural, and declension forms. Verbs may show indicative, imperative, perfect, subjunctive, and past participle data. Adjectives may show comparative, superlative, and declension forms. Forms without a supported category are omitted instead of being shown in a fallback group. Missing or unsupported fields are omitted instead of showing empty placeholders. Loading, empty, and error states are shown for both search and entry loading.

## Custom Collection Editor (`/custom-collections/new`, `/custom-collections/$id/edit`)

Custom collections are local-only and persisted in IndexedDB on the current device. Creating a collection first creates a draft, then redirects to the editor for that draft. The editor supports title, description, comma-separated tags, free-input/slot-input mode, and challenge add/edit/remove/reorder operations.

Each challenge has an optional prompt (`original`) and a required answer (`translation`). Parentheses in answers keep the existing pre-filled hint behaviour. Empty answer rows may exist in drafts but are filtered out of playable collections. The Practice action is disabled until the collection is valid.

The editor also supports AI chat import as a local-only helper. Langtype generates a copyable prompt for the user's preferred external AI chat, but never calls AI providers and never stores prompts, pasted JSON, provider names, API keys, or AI metadata. The prompt asks the AI to return only one JSON code block containing an array of challenges with ordered `segments`; `type` segments are learner-typed German text, and `prefill` segments are automatic context/hints. Users paste the copied JSON code block content into Langtype, review a preview, then insert valid rows.

AI chat import accepts raw top-level JSON arrays and tolerates one accidentally pasted outer ` ```json ` fenced block. Segment rows must include at least one non-empty `type` segment, may include `prefill` segments, and must use non-empty text. Adjacent segments of the same kind are merged. On insertion, `prefill` segments are converted to native parenthesized answer markup and `type` segments are left unwrapped. As an advanced fallback, rows with native non-empty `translation` strings are accepted unchanged. Valid rows append to the current draft with generated local challenge ids; invalid rows are skipped and counted in the preview.

Deleting a custom collection asks for confirmation, removes the local collection, and clears its SRS progress.

## Collection Page (`/collections/$id`)

All state lives in URL search params. The page renders one of four views depending on `?mode` and `?view`:

| URL params | Renders |
|---|---|
| _(none)_ | Mode picker — choose Practice All or SRS |
| `?view=progress` | Progress view — per-card due/new/upcoming breakdown |
| `?mode=normal` | Game — all cards shuffled, no SRS recording |
| `?mode=srs` | Game — only due cards, full SRS flow (see below) |

Bundled collections are loaded by the route loader. Local custom collection deep links (`/collections/custom_*`) wait for IndexedDB-backed custom collection storage to hydrate before deciding whether the collection exists. If the custom collection is not saved on the current device or is still a draft with no playable challenges, the collection route shows a local "Collection not found" state instead of the root 404.

Back button always navigates to `?` (clears params) → mode picker. Retry state is reset via a `useEffect` watching `mode`, not before `navigate()`, to avoid a transient render where `mode=srs` + `retryCount=0` would flash the all-done screen.

## SRS Session Flow

```
[Mode picker] → startSRS() → mode=srs
    ↓
[Game] — due cards only, shuffled into sessionQueue
  • correct, non-ASAP answer → recordReviewWithInterval(), timer resumes → advance
  • correct, ASAP answer     → recordReviewWithInterval(0) → card reinserted 2–10 ahead in sessionQueue
  • wrong answer             → recordReview('incorrect'), nextReviewAt=now → card reinserted 2–10 ahead
    ↓
[Card keeps reappearing until answered with a non-ASAP interval]
  If user keeps answering wrong or picks ASAP, card is reinserted again each time.
    ↓
[handleFinished — currentIndex reaches end of sessionQueue with no pending reinsertion]
  → goToPicker()
    ↓
[All done screen — shown when mode=srs but challenges.length===0]
  Reached if: 0 cards due at session start, OR navigating back during session.
```

## SRS Algorithm (`src/lib/srsAlgorithm.ts`)

- **`computeReview(card, grade)`** — SM-2: `incorrect` resets reps + EF−0.2, interval=0, nextReviewAt=now; `hard` EF−0.1, shorter interval; `correct` EF+0.1, longer interval.
- **`computeReviewFromInterval(card, intervalDays)`** — bypasses SM-2; sets nextReviewAt directly and nudges EF/reps by magnitude (ASAP→−0.2/reset, 1w→+0.15/+1 rep).
- **`isCardDue(card)`** — true if `nextReviewAt === 0` (new) or `nextReviewAt <= now`.

## Progress View

Cards are bucketed into three groups: **due** (`isCardDue` = true and `lastReviewedAt > 0`), **new** (`lastReviewedAt === 0`), **upcoming** (not due, sorted by `nextReviewAt` ascending). Time until review is formatted by `formatTimeUntil()` in `SRSProgressView.tsx`.

## Normal Mode

All collection challenges shuffled. Game receives no `srsContext` — no SRS recording, no interval pills, no retry phase. Timer auto-advances after correct (5s) or incorrect (5s) answer.

## Game Internals

- Status lifecycle: `typing` → `completed` (correct) or `submitted` (incorrect) → auto-advance (or wait for pill in SRS mode)
- In SRS mode, correct answer pauses the timer (`setIsPaused(true)`) until a pill is selected, then restarts with a 2-second countdown.
- Recording fires exactly once per card via `hasRecordedRef` (reset on `status=typing`), triggered when `timeLeft === 0`.
- The internal `sessionQueue` starts equal to `challenges` and grows as cards are reinserted. The "X cards remaining" counter is `sessionQueue.length - currentIndex - 1`.
- Wrong answers and ASAP interval reinsert the card at a random position 2–10 ahead in `sessionQueue` (capped at the end). `pendingReinsertRef` prevents `onFinished` from firing in the same render as a reinsertion.
- Normal mode also uses reinsertion for wrong answers. The session ends when `currentIndex` reaches `sessionQueue.length - 1` without a reinsertion.
